This is a little project for some very specific content management
in our club at uni. I used this to learn about development process 
in Gnu Smalltalk with Seaside, after having used Seaside in Squeak 
for a couple of years now.

I loosely modelled the folder structure after Rails, but it's not
actually thought out, I just made it all up as I went along. Same
goes for the scripts, they aren't clean, they just do what they'd
been written to do at the time, with a very specific environment.

I just keep these here in case Seaside and Gnu Smalltalk turn out
to be the next best thing after sliced bread. Then I might extend
the scripts to work more reliably.

Anyway, for trying, just run scripts/setup to create your project
and use scripts/create to get some classes scaffolded. After that
use scripts/updateAll and scripts/server to file in code and exec
the Swazoo server on port :8080
